1) What is the difference between named export, default export, and * as export?
- NAMED EXPORT means using the exact name while importing that export. We can have multiple named exports from a single file. 
eg: // exports from ./MyComponent.js file
export const MyComponent = () => {}

// importing it as 
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

- We can have a single DEFAULT EXPORT from a single file. While importing we can use any name ,but it is recommended to use same name.
eg: //export from ./MyComponent.js file
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;

//importing it
import MyDefaultComponent from "./MyComponent";  OR import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

- * as export/import means we can use a single object to import all named exports
e.g:  // exports from ./MyComponent.js file
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}

//importing it
import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";
// we can use MainComponents.MyComponent and MainComponents.MyComponent2 in our code
